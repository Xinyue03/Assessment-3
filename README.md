Project name: "Epidemic City Button"


This project was created so that more people could see the impact of 2020 the new crown virus. It is a visual 

representation of the data changes that exist in each country and even in each state.


The procedure is very simple.

The first step is to identify the country (or state) data you want to see and enter the name of the address in the filter.

Secondly, you can hover your mouse over the map and the data will be displayed. 

Thirdly, you can select one of the 13 country flags provided and click on it. You will then be able to access all relevant data for that country.


In general, the data is not very complete but it conveys most of what I wanted to say through the data. In the data

 source, there are some countries that cannot be presented in the Excel table because of corruption. Inside 

Tableau, I have tried to use code to do calculations (e.g. Sum values, averages) to work out the percentage of 

people cured in each country.

There are no operational problems with this project, but improvements are still needed regarding the integrity of 

the data.
